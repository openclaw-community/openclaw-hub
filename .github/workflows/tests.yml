      - name: Run mypy
        run: mypy src/ --ignore-missing-imports || true
        continue-on-error: true
```

**Note:** I added `continue-on-error: true` and `|| true` to some steps so the workflow won't fail while you're building the project. Remove these later when you have actual code.

### Step 4: Commit the File
1. Scroll down to the **"Commit new file"** section
2. In the commit message box, type:
```
   ci: Add GitHub Actions workflow for tests and linting
   
   - Run tests on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
   - Run ruff and mypy for code quality
   - Upload coverage reports
   - Set to continue-on-error during initial development
